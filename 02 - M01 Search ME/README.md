# Lab 02-M01 Search ME

This lab builds on Lab 02 to add a Search message extension

## Instructions:

No special instructions

## Discussion items:

1. No easy way to correlate selectItem activities. I invented one but IMO the AI SDK should handle this.

2. Would an ME module ever need access to application state?
   Note the more elegant way of wiring it up I used in the supplier ME. Which do you prefer?

3. I like the new @microsoft/adaptivecards-tools but - where are the docs?
